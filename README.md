# getClosestAircraft

## MADE USING PYTHON 3.8

### INSTALLATION

Run the getClosestAircraft.py file once, then input your coordinates into coords.py. Flightradar24 uses 4 decimal places, so we reccomend that as well.

### DETAILS

The program will scan for aircraft within 5 degrees of latitude and longitude of your location, and return details about the closest one.

### FUTURE

It is planned for this to become an Alexa Skill in the future.
